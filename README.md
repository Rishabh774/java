# Java DSA Practice Questions

This repository contains my personal solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions using Java. I am a student, and I use this repo to practice, improve my coding skills, and prepare for interviews or exams.

## What’s Inside

- Java solutions to a variety of DSA problems
- Problems covering arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, graphs, sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming
- My approaches and code comments to help me understand each solution

## How I Use This Repo

- Practice: I solve DSA problems in Java and organize my solutions here.
- Learning: I revisit old solutions to review concepts or improve my code.
- Interview Prep: I use this as a reference before coding interviews or tests.
## How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishabh774/java.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse).**
3. **Navigate to the question or topic you want to try out.**
4. **Run the Java files using their `main` methods.**
## Notes
- These are my own solutions. They may not be optimal or perfect, but I’m always trying to learn and improve.
- If you are also learning DSA, feel free to browse through my code for ideas!
